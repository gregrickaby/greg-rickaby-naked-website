      <h3>Published Author</h3>
      <p>
        In 2017, I wrote a children&apos;s book titled{" "}
        <a href="https://amzn.to/34QAxAQ">
          <em>
            <strong>Creating a Website for Dummies Jr</strong>
          </em>
        </a>{" "}
        which was published by{" "}
        <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us"> Wiley Global</a> under the{" "}
        <a href="https://www.dummies.com/">dummies‚Ñ¢Ô∏è</a> brand.
      </p>

      <p>
        The book guides young readers through the planning and development
        processes of building a website. It has been translated into other 2
        other languages, and currently has a 4.5-star rating on Amazon.
      </p>

      <h3>Photographer</h3>
      <p>
        In late 2019, I bought a mirrorless camera and spent months taking
        courses, reading, practicing, and having my work critiqued by peers.
        What has started as an enjoyable hobby, has turned into a passionate way
        to express my creativity.

      <h3>Contributions</h3>
      <p>
        I've been part of the WordPress community since 2008. I've made
        contributions to core, documentation, plugins, and themes. I've also
        spoken at WordCamps and meet-ups. I'm also a contributor to other
        open-source projects like Next.js, Storybook, and Gatsby.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of tech, I volunteer my time and efforts at local community
        organizations. The Boy Scouts, Wiregrass Church, and the Enterprise High
        School Band Boosters to name a few.
