          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            With over two decades of web development expertise, my journey began
            in the early days of the internet, hacking away at my first website
            on
            <button id="toggleGeocities">Geocities</button> in 1997.
          </p>
          <p>
            By 1999, I was working full-time on dynamic web applications using
            (classic) ASP, laying the groundwork for a long career in tech. In
            2006, I transitioned to WordPress, harnessing its power to create
            dynamic, user-friendly sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            My passion for innovation led me to embrace modern JavaScript
            frameworks, and since 2019, I've been thriving as a full-stack
            developer, specializing in React and Next.js to build cutting-edge
            web applications.

          <h3>Author</h3>
          <p>
            In 2017, I wrote a children's book titled
            <a href="https://amzn.to/41eZFfF" rel="nofollow sponsored" title=""
              ><em><strong>Creating a Website for Dummies Jr</strong></em></a
            >
            which Wiley Global published under the
            <a href="https://www.dummies.com/">dummies‚Ñ¢Ô∏è</a> brand.
          </p>

          <p>
            The book guides young readers through the planning and development
            processes of building a website. It has been translated into other 2
            other languages and currently has a 4.5-star rating on Amazon.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since being published, I've also served as the Technical Editor on
            three other books:

          <h3>Contributor</h3>

          <p>
            I've been part of the WordPress community since 2008. I've made
            contributions to core, documentation, plugins, and themes. I've also
            spoken at WordCamps and meet-ups. I also contribute to other
            open-source projects like Next.js, Storybook, and Gatsby.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of tech, I've volunteered my time and efforts at local
            community organizations. The Boy Scouts, Wiregrass Church, and the
            Enterprise High School Band Boosters to name a few.
          </p>

          <h3>Photographer</h3>
          <p>
            Photographer In late 2019, I purchased a Lumix GX85 and dedicated
            several months to taking courses, reading, practicing, and receiving
            feedback from my peers. I started out as a modest hobbyist but have
            since become a passionate enthusiast who appreciates various forms
            of photography, such as landscape, events, wildlife, street, and
            astrophotography.
